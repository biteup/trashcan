# Toriaezu (とりあえず)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wheresmybento/toriaezu.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/wheresmybento/toriaezu)

> Mobile Web prototypal client application that interacts with the Snakebite API server. Standing in for [Adam](https://github.com/wheresmybento/adam) as a prototype.

## Introduction

Toriaezu's basic building blocks are:

- Ember JS: so that we can all that frontend MVC framework goodness!
- Ionic Framework's CSS: for quick prototyping of native-looking mobile-web applications
- Mocha (possibly): for unit tests
- Http-Server: just to run static files via `npm` commands (you can just simply run `$ cd build && python -m SimpleHTTPServer` if you prefer)

Check each of these great libraries above if you have time or interest!

## Setting up

We need Node JS installed before installing Bower to manage some of our dependencies

1. Download and install Node JS if you have not
2. Install bower via `$ npm install -g bower` if you have not
3. clone this repository
4 Install node packages via `$ npm install`
5. Install bower components, via `$ bower install`
6. Run the app with `$ npm start` or use python's SimpleHTTPServer if you like
7. Point your browser to http://localhost:8080, and grab a pint.
